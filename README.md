# What is this?

[Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org) is a blockchain application platform.
This list intends on providing a summarized version for anyone interested in learning how to create, manage a distrubuted applications using Ethereum.

When should I implement blockchains? [This answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40999040/blockchain-concepts-implementations) is a great overview of blockchain concepts and comparing Ethereum to [Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric). It's a good idea to know when to use one or the other.
